# Problem Statement:
## can we use computer vision to detect skin cancer
### if we can detect skin cancer early we can have isnurance companies raise the rates of their clients so the insurance company will not have to suffer losses 

# Results:

## We are able to detect melanoma with computer vision
## We can improve accuracy with more images
## With more work we can one day create a computer vision system that can detect cancer with a higher accuracy and much faster 
## while KNN works it take longer and detects less accurately
